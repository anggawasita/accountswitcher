#v2.4
* Removed ZombieWizzard's vita-activator option since it's not working correctly and i don't have the time check why. Use henkaku's psn spoofing for now.
* Minor bugfixes and text fixes
* Better method to persist offline henkaku when switching accounts
* Trial accounts are now supported
* Added more stuff to the cleanup script

#v2.3:
* Removed current account check (it was pointless to begin with, there are situations when you need to reload such as deactivating)
* Added LiveArea

#v2.2:
* Trophies glitch fixed (Error NP-6174-8) (Remember to sync your trophies before switching if you dont want to lose them)
